# Template Robot Controller

This repository is a template for our `FtcRobotController`s.
It is a fork of FTC's official [FtcRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git).
Please feel free to modify this template as necessary or even abandon it altogether.
This template is meant to be a gift from the previous programmers to the new programmers.
What you do with it is up to you.

However, this template is meant for general code to be reused across seasons,
so if you do use it, please refrain from putting anything year specific into this template,
e.g., motor names or autonomous commands.

## Creating a New Repo

> [!Important]
> Only organization owners have the privileges to delete repos owned by chsRobotix.
> Before creating a repo under chsRobotix, consider if it is necessary.
> If not, create it under your own account.

1. On the GitHut website, create a new repo.
2. Under "Repository template", select "chsRobotix/TemplateRobotController".
3. Under "Owner", select "chsRobotix".
4. Name the repository.
   Preferably, the format for naming the repository should be "{starting year}-{season name in `kebab-case`}".
5. If you desire, add a short description, but it is probably unnecessary.
6. Click "Public" to set the repo's visibility.
7. Click "Create Repository".

## Pulling from Template

By default, GitHub does not allow users to pull from a template,
which complicates updating the new repository if the template changes.
To pull from the template, enter into a terminal:

```shell
git remote add template https://github.com/chsRobotix/TemplateRobotController.git
git pull template main
```

> [!Caution]
> Before you pull changes from this template,
> ensure that the new changes will not break the current code.
> It is best to pull the changes from `template` into a branch
> and then merge it into the `main` branch.

## Updating with FTC's FtcRobotController

Keep this fork up to date with FTC's
official [FtcRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git).
To do that, go to the GitHub page for [this repository](https://github.com/chsRobotix/TemplateRobotController.git)
and click on "Sync fork."
Alternatively, you can enter into a terminal:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git
git pull upstream master
```

## RoadRunner

Our programs use [RoadRunner](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner.git), a motion-planning library for FTC.
For more details look at [Learn Road Runner](https://learnroadrunner.com/introduction.html)
and the [Road Runner Docs](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/installation/)(may be blocked by school Wi-Fi).

### Tuning RoadRunner

The following is modified from the [Road Runner Docs](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/tuning/),
which may be blocked by school Wi-Fi.

1. Open either `MecanumDrive` or `TankDrive` depending on your bot.
2. Set the logo and USB direction of your IMU
   using the instructions on [this page](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/imu/imu.html?highlight=imu#physical-hub-mounting).
3. In `TuningOpModes`, set the `DRIVE_CLASS` variable to the drive class you're using.
4. Then specify how the robot should track its position. There are a few built-in localizers:
   - Drive encoders: This is the default. The IMU will also be used on mecanum to get better heading.
   - Two (dead) wheel: Change the right-hand-side of `localizer =` (mecanum, tank) to
     `new TwoDeadWheelLocalizer(hardwareMap, lazyImu.get(), PARAMS.inPerTick, pose)`.
     The code expects the parallel, forward-pointing encoder to be named `"par"`
     and the perpendicular one to be named `"perp"`.
   - Three (dead) wheel: Change the right-hand-side of `localizer =` (mecanum, tank) to
     `new ThreeDeadWheelLocalizer(hardwareMap, PARAMS.inPerTick, pose)`.
     The code expects the two parallel encoders to be named `"par0"` and `"par1"`
     and the perpendicular one to be named `"perp"`.
   - Pinpoint Odometry Computer: Change the right-hand-side of `localizer =` (mecanum, tank) to
     `new PinpointLocalizer(hardwareMap, PARAMS.inPerTick, pose)`.
     The code expects a `Pinpoint` device to be configured with name `"pinpoint"`.
     Tuning for a `Pinpoint` device is the same as tuning for two dead wheels.

5. Now check that the motors spin in the right direction. Positive power on all wheels should move
   the robot forward. And if you're using drive encoders, the ticks recorded should increase in a
   positive direction.

   Those with mecanum drives should use `MecanumDirectionDebugger` 
   to make sure all the directions are correct.
   The `OpMode` uses the following button mappings:

   > Xbox/PS4 Button - Motor
   >     X / ▢ - Front Left
   >     Y / Δ - Front Right
   >     B / O - Rear Right
   >     A / X - Rear Left
   >                                The buttons are mapped to match the wheels spatially if you
   >                                were to rotate the gamepad 45°. x/▢ is the front-left,
   >                ________        and each button corresponds to the wheel as you go clockwise.
   >               / ______ \
   > ------------.-'   _  '-..+              Front of Bot
   >          /   _  ( Y )  _  \                  ^
   >         |  ( X )  _  ( B ) |     Front Left   \    Front Right
   >    ___  '.      ( A )     /|       Wheel       \      Wheel
   >  .'    '.    '-._____.-'  .'       (x/▢)        \     (Y/Δ)
   > |       |                 |                      \
   >  '.___.' '.               |          Rear Left    \   Rear Right
   >           '.             /             Wheel       \    Wheel
   >            \.          .'              (A/X)        \   (B/O)
   >              \________/

   Reverse any motors running in the wrong direction with `setDirection(...)`
   and do the same for corresponding drive encoders as well.

   If you're using dead wheels, run `DeadWheelDirectionDebugger` and reverse those encoders accordingly.

6. Connect to the robot Wi-Fi.
7. Open [FTC Dashboard](http://192.168.43.1:8080/dash).
8. Now begin the tuning process.

   > [!Important]
   > The params on the Dashboard ***ARE NOT SAVED***.
   > To save them,
   > go to [MecanumDrive](./TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/MecanumDrive.java)
   > and edit the appropriate variables.

9. Use `ForwardPushTest` to determine `inPerTick`.
   The program should print the current number of ticks.
   Push the robot forward by a certain number of inches. 
   Set `inPerTick = <number of inches> / <number of ticks>`

10. Use `LateralPushTest` to determine `lateralInPerTick`.

### Updating RoadRunner

To update RoadRunner in this repository, enter:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart.git ../road-runner-quickstart
find ../road-runner-quickstart/ -name "*.md" -type f -delete
mv -rf ../road-runner-quickstart/* ./
rm -rf ../road-runner-quickstart
```

## TeamCode

Our team's code is in 
[./TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/](./TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/).
It contains an Autonomous, TeleOp, and various helper classes to ease the process of programming the robot.
For more details, including how `OpMode`s work, 
look at the [README](./TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/README.md).
