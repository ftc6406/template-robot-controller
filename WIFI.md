Command to connect to robot through ADB (Windows):

```shell
C:/Users/<your username>/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe connect 192.168.43.1:5555
```

Alternatively, you could add the .exe to the PATH variable so you do not have to type out the full filepath.
However, that requires administrative privileges. If you do not have administrative privileges,
then you have to type out the full path.
